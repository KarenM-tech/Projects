Dangerous Terrain Game 
    Player P starts at the bottom of the game world at a random column with energy level 7.
    A move in any direction subtracts 1 from the player's total energy level. The objective of the game is
    to reach the top of the game world without running out of energy or bumping into a mine.
    M represents a mine. The game ends if the player bumps into a mine
    # represents an immovable obstacle. The player cannot move over this.
    T represents a temporary energy unit. The player's energy level is recharged by 5 units when it passes over one of these.
